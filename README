=======  Minimalism  =======

- Based on minimalism with basic commands
- No more target system or hardware
- Just run and enjoy your little system

=======  Unix Design =======

- You can add (modprobe, insmod, delmod etc.) device drivers like Linux kernel
- Targetting to use ELF executable system

=======   Why not?  =======

- Why I don't make a OS? it's learning process
- Indeed, it's amateur design, but I'm college student
- Hobbies are always good
